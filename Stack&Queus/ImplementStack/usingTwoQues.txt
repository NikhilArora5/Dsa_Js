#stack standard opeartions
-push ,pop , top/peek-stack[n-1] as top , isEmpty to return if stack empty or not

#using two ques
-operations : push (enqueue) , Q[0] peek/frontend , Q.shift() to remove first out

#Logic used
1.push is same
2.pop => we have two queues q1 and q2 so and one time one will be main queue and other will be a temp
-so what we will do is from the mai queu we will do Q.shift() and will enqueue(push) it to the temp queues
-we will do this for n-1 times and now the main queu will have only the last element and for last element
-we will do Q.shift() but will not enqueue/push to the temp queue
-IMP aft this we will shift the Queues temp will become main queue and main will become temp

3.top/seek=>same as pop just at the end we push the last as well
